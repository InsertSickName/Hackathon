Types of fraud detected

1) Ghost Farmers and Fake invoices
    case 1: Dealers inflate beneficiary lists with fake or non-existent farmers.
    Subsidies are claimed in their names but never delivered.
    Dealers generate invoices for supplies that were never delivered.
    case 2: Paper records show distribution, but farmers never receive inputs.

2) Inflated Input Quantities
    Farmers are shown as receiving fertilizer or seeds far beyond their actual landholding capacity.
    Excess stock is diverted to the open market at higher prices.

3) Collusion Among Dealers
    Groups of dealers within the same region work together to inflate subsidy claims.
    The resulting patterns show geographically concentrated anomalies, indicating organized networks diverting benefits away from genuine farmers.

4) Misreporting Crop/Season Data
    Dealers claim subsidies for crops not actually grown or for seasons when no planting occurred.
    Exploits gaps in monitoring across crop cycles.

5) Price Manipulation
